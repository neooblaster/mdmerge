# mdmerge

I developed `mdmerge` for my own usage.
I was tired to update my main `README.md` file
when it contains some codes (all or part of) from an existing file.

When the source file change, your `README.md` must be manually updated.

So I create my own **Node.js** application to update my `README.md`
which using other files thanks to a custom instruction which is
invisible in the rendered document (also in PDF document).

Currently, the application is not fully finished but the main feature are finished.

## Getting Start

Coming later (not soon, I don't know when I can complete the README ;) )
